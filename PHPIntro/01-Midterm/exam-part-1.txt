### Problem

Suppose we are given the following user information from querying a social
network database:

USER table
+----+------------+------------------+--------------+
| id | profile_id | email            | join_date    |
+----+------------+------------------+--------------+
|  1 |          5 | john@example.com | Feb 13, 2012 |
|  4 |         15 | jack12@yahoo.com | Mar 01, 2013 |
| 10 |         97 | meghan@yahoo.com | Sep 22, 2015 |
+----+------------+------------------+--------------+

We can read the first row as "The user with id 1 has a profile_id of 5, an
email of john@example.com, and a join_date of Feb 13, 2012"

Create an array $users representing the information contained in the query
above. If your array is structured correctly, the following expressions will
be true:

* $users[4]['email'] == 'jack12@yahoo.com'
* $users[10]['profile_id'] == 97

Answer:



























### Problem

Suppose we are making a more complex query to the same social network
database. In addition to results from the USER table, we have also been
provided with data from a related PROFILE table.

USER table
+----+------------+------------------+--------------+
| id | profile_id | email            | join_date    |
+----+------------+------------------+--------------+
|  1 |          5 | john@example.com | Feb 13, 2012 |
|  4 |         15 | jack12@yahoo.com | Mar 01, 2013 |
| 10 |         97 | meghan@yahoo.com | Sep 22, 2015 |
+----+------------+------------------+--------------+

PROFILE table
+----+------------+-----------+--------------+
| id | first_name | last_name | phone_number |
+----+------------+-----------+--------------+
|  5 |       John |       Doe | 512-111-2211 |
| 15 |       Jack |   Daniels | 512-555-2323 |
| 97 |     Meghan | McDaniels | 512-987-5434 |
+----+------------+------------------+-------+

The two tables are structured such that the profile_id in the USER table is
associated with the id in the PROFILE table. According to this structure, the
last name of the user with id 10 is "McDaniels".

Create an array $users representing the information contained in BOTH of the
queries above. Each individual user in the $users array should have a
'profile' key containing their information from the PROFILE table.
