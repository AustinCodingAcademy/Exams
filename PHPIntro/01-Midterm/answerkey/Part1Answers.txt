Answer:

No. The markup should be outside of the php blocks, or the markup should be
echod as a string.






Section 5 - Arrays
------------------

### Problem 14

Explain the difference between a sequential array and an associative array

   Objectives:

     * Associative arrays
     * Sequential arrays

Answer:

Sequential arrays are ordered arrays with elements, where each element has an
index. An associative array is an array containing key value pairs. Order is
generally not important in an associative array.

array

   Objectives:

     * Associative arrays

d) foreach loop

Definition: A loop that performs a series of actions for each element in an
array.

Objectives:

 * foreach loops

### Problem 16

a) What function can you use to see how many elements are in an array?

     * Sequential arrays

Answer: echo count($grades);



### Problem 17

a) How do you access the element of an array named $nums located at index $n?

   Objectives:

   Objectives:

     * Sequential arrays

Answer:

$nums[count($nums)-1]

    array(
        "student_name" => "Jill",
        "grade" => 92
    ),
    array(
        "student_name" => "Jack",
        "grade" => 87
    ),
    array(
        "student_name" => "Jaime",
        "grade" => 95
    ),
)

            'illness' => 'Sore Throat',
            'admittance_time' => '04:30 PM'
        ),
        array(
            'name' => 'Noam Chomsky',
            'illness' => 'Twisted Ankle',
            'admittance_time' => '01:30 AM'
        ),
        array(
            'name' => 'Hacker McHackerson',
            'illness' => 'Carpel Tunnel',
            'admittance_time' => '10:30 PM'

Section 6 - Conditionals
------------------------


### Problem 21

Given the following code snippet...

    <?php
    echo "I am an animal";
    if ($animal == "whale") {
        echo " and I have a spout!";
    }
    else if ($animal == "elephant") {
        echo " and I have a trunk!";
    }
    ?>

...what will it output if the value of $animal is...

a) "whale" ?

   Objectives:

     * Conditional statements

Answer: I am an animal and I have a spout!


b) "elephant" ?

   Objectives:

     * Conditional statements

Answer: I am an animal and I have a trunk!


c) "dolphin" ?

   Objectives:

     * Conditional statements

Answer: I am an animal


### Problem 22

What will the following code output?

    <?php
    $x = 5
    if ($x > 3) {
        echo "Some say the world will end in fire<br>";
    }
    if ($x < 8) {
        echo "Some say in ice<br>";
    }
    $x += 5;
    if ($x > 8) {
        echo "(Either would suffice)<br>";
    }
    ?>
    
   Objectives:

     * Conditional statements

Answer:

Some say the world will end in fire
Some say in ice
(Either would suffice)



Section 7 - CSVs
----------------

### Problem 23

What are CSV files?  What are they used for?

Answer: Comma Separated Value files. They store tabular data in a format that
can be easily exchanged between spreadsheet programs and programming
languages.


### Problem 24

In class, we used 2 different methods to import a CSV file into our PHP code as an array.
The 1st method we used produced a sequential array of sequential arrays.
The 2nd method was a bit more complicated but it produced a sequential array of associative arrays.

Why would we want to use the 2nd method?  Why might the associative arrays be a more useful result?

   Objectives:

     * Associative arrays

Answer: Using associative arrays with CSVs produce more readable code. This is
because using keys to access values within the array is more explicit than
using a seemingly arbitrary index number.




Section 8 - Functions
---------------------

### Problem 25

Observe the following function:

    <?php

    function greaterOfTwo($x, $y) {
        if ($x > $y) {
            return $x;
        }
        elseif ($y > $x) {
            return $y;
        }
    }

    ?>

   Objectives:

     * Functions

Answer: $x, $y


c) What does this function do?

   Objectives:

     * Functions
     * Conditionals

    <?php

        function overwrite($x, $y){
            $x = 10;
            return $x + $y;
        }

        $x = 5;
        $y = 10;

        echo overwrite($x, $y);
        echo "x: $x<br>";
